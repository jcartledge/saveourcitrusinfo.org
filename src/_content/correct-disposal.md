## Correct  Disposal.

![placeholder](//lorempixel.com/400/300)

Do not dispose of infected material in your green bin or compost. The galls will still hatch and may re-infect your tree - and your neighbours.

Ideally infected prunings should be burnt. Check with your local Council guidelines.  And always conduct any incineration in a safe manner.

If incineration is not an option, double bag the infected material and put in your rubbish bin - not your green bin.

Other disposal techniques include cutting through the galls with secateurs, and immersing the galls in water for several weeks.
