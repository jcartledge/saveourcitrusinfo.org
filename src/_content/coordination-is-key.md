## Co-ordination is Key.

Problems arise when trees are pruned at the wrong time or not pruned at all leaving the wasp to spread and contaminate new trees.

If we all prune by late August and destroy infected material correctly we can reduce the spread of Citrus Gall Wasp.

Have you noticed trees in your area that are not maintained? Or do you have an elderly neighbour who can not look after their tree?  Overall, the infestation rates will improve when as many trees as possible are treated at the same time, so if possible please help your friends and neighbours to care for their citrus trees.

**Be a good neighbour and a friend to lemon trees and get with the program.**
