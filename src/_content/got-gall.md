### What is Gall?

Gall is lumpy growths that occur in Citrus trees infected by the [native Citrus Gall Wasp - (Bruchophagus fellis)](http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/340609/Citrus-gall-wasp-in-southern-australia.pdf).

Originally, this native wasp was limited to Queensland and northern New South Wales where if fed on native finger limes. But the citrus gall wasp has adapted to a wider variety of citrus fruits. Since the 1990â€™s it has successfully migrated through NSW to Melbourne where it is now virtually endemic in the back yard lemon tree.

The Citrus Gall wasp has a 12 month lifecycle starting in spring when it lays eggs in the fresh new stems of the citrus tree. The eggs hatch two to four weeks later and begin feeding inside the stems. This causes the tree to produce swollen lumpy stems known as Galls. The wasp larvae grow within the soft stem tissue for 9 to 12 months until they pupate and emerge as adult wasps the following year. Adult citrus gall wasps are rarely seen as they less than 3mm in size.

### Can I leave the gall in the tree?

No. Not only does Citrus Gall wasp reduce your trees fruit production, but it also causes a slow decline of the trees health, eventually killing it. When the wasps emerge from the galls they will re-infect the host tree and infect other trees in your neighbourhood.

### Can I eat fruit from a tree with gall?

Yes. The fruit is unaffected.
