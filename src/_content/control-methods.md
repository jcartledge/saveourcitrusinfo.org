## Control Methods.

### Avoid high nitrogen fertilizers in spring.

Fertilizing with a high nitrogen content in spring will promote excessive new soft growth which is very attractive to the wasp.

Avoid using ‘sticky’ yellow traps as they also kill beneficial insects. 

Two similar sized parasitic wasps, Megastigmus brevivalvus and M. trisulcus, are predators of the Citrus Gall Wasp. These are honey-coloured and can be easily distinguished from the black coloured Citrus Gall Wasp adults. The parasitic wasps lay their eggs directly into Citrus Gall Wasp eggs, feeding on and eventually killing their hosts. Up to 90% of gall wasp larvae can be parasitised. 

Monitor your citrus trees for signs of infestation between June and September when galls are at their largest and most visible. 

Prune active galls out as they appear. Remove all gall material by late August  before the wasps begin to hatch.

### Pruning Technique

Prune directly below the infected area. Cut just above 
the first outward facing shoot.

If your tree is heavily infected, requiring a hard prune, you may not get fruit for 2 years.
